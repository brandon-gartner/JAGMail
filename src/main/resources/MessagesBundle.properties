Help = This is a simple email client.  \n\nYou can type out your message, click send/receive, and it will both send the email you've written, and check to see if it has received any new emails.  \n\nYou can click 'Save Draft' to save the data on the email editor into the drafts folder for your computer. \n\nYou can drag an email to another folder, to change the folder that it's in.  You can use the buttons 'add attachment' and 'save attachment' to add attachments to the email you're writing, or to save the attachment of the email you're selecting.  \n\nYou can right-click on any email in the table, and choose to either delete it, forward it, or reply to it. \n\nYou can also click 'Create Folder', which will prompt you for a name for the new folder, and then create it, or click 'Delete Folder', which will send you a prompt asking if you really do want to delete the current folder. \n\nFinally, under File, you can click Config. to modify the parameters you're using to connect to the client, or Close, to close the program. \n\n
